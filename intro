In 1949 Andre Weil, in his Paper "Number of solutions of equations in finite fields", formulated his famous Weil-Conjectures
which predicted certain deep properties of the Hasse-Weil zeta function for a Variety $X$ over a finite field $k = \mathbb{F}_q$ defined as
\[
    Z(X,t) = exp \big(\sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{|X(\mathbb{F}_{q^m}}{m} t^m} \big)
\]

The rationality of the zeta function, the most basic of the three conjectures, was first established by Dwork. Grothendieck later gave another
proof using his new scheme-theoretic approach to algebraic geometry, an approach that was in large parts motivated by the desire to proof the
Weil conjectures. 
Grothendieck's revolutionary new perspective was fundamental for the work of Deligne, who used these new methods to finally establish the 
last part of the conjectures, an analouge of the Riemann hypothesis, in 1974.
In this thesis we want to generalize the Hasse-Weil zeta function to a broader setting, not only talking about varieties over finite fields
but varieties in general. It turns out that in this more general setting the zeta function isn't as well behaved in terms of rationality as
the "classical" Hasse-Weil zetafunction and we will investigate this phenomen more closely in the case of complex surfaces, following the 
work of Larsen and Lunts.
